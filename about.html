          <h2>It's More than Bags, Jewelry, &amp; Artwork...</h2>
          <p>Equality, Community, and Creativity. These simple values are the soul behind Berwick. Yes, we make beautiful high quality bags and jewelry and feature artwork by local DC artists but that's also the avenue through which we are able to give back to the community through charitable partnerships and responsible manufacture and sale of our goods. It's a mission that goes beyond DC though. Part of the reason we're so excited to do this in Washington is to set an example for the rest of the country. To create stores and products, whatever they might be, that give back and are made in local communities.</p>

          <p>Berwick is the brain child of Ben Serres and Derrick Bryant and the store will be opening Summer of 2013. The idea started one weekend when we realized how dedicated to the community DC residents really are. Take Eastern Market for example, or all of the local restaurants that proudly display where the day's produce is from. We really do care where our stuff comes from. It reminded us of a small town in Scotland by the name of North Berwick. While we were there the sense of community, and "everbody knows everybody-ness" was inspiring. Even though North Berwick is a village, and DC is a big federal city you can still get this feeling every weekend, and that's what we want Berwick to contirbute to. Coming from a background of business, IT, and government we're excited to be able to unleash our creativity on DC and help you explore your creativity. </p> <p> At Berwick, everything is either produced in the store, or sourced from local DC artists.</p>
